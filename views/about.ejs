				<p>Victoria Telfer is a childrenâ€™s author and illustrator currently residing in Southern California 
				with her husband and dog. Her passion for the written word consumes much of her life and it is her 
				greatest hope to infuse children with the same passion bestowed to her by all the greats who came 
				before. In between reading and writing, Victoria is also studying to become a Neurodiagnostic Technologist. 
				Through her studies of anatomy and physiology she has developed a special appreciation for the magic 
				and the mechanisms of the human body that she intends to share with children in future projects.
